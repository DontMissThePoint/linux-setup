## 1. About

These three scripts (called `TDAB` for short) will create side or top bars 
(or a "devour" style new pane) that run a command inside tmux.  See the image 
above to get an idea of what this means.  

The name is a play on "A *blank* walks into a bar", because puns.

## 2. License

## 3. Prerequisites

* tmux
* bash
* bc

These scripts will *probably* work in other shells, but I don't know for sure.

## 4. Installation

Clone or download the repository.  Put the scripts (or symlinks to the scripts) 
in your `$PATH`.  (In the example above, I've symlinked them to `sidebar`, 
`topbar`, and `devour`.)  

### Tip for `Devour`

I find a binding like the following *very* useful when using `devour`:

`bind-key -n C-/ select-pane -R \;\`
`resize-pane -Z`

This will allow you to cycle among the zoomed panes - and will zoom each as you 
go through it.  Very nice for programs like [emojin](https://github.com/peterjschroeder/emojin). 

## 5. Usage

`SCRIPTNAME [--offset NUMBER] [--hold] [program to run]`

For example, `tmux-sidebar.sh man man` will show you the man page for man in 
the sidebar.  

**The optional command line arguments are POSITIONAL.** 

Resizing the bars can be done with the command line argument --offset which is 
expressed in the percentage of the screen you want for the *main* window. This 
must be the first and second argument used. For example, to have a main window 
taking up 90% of the screen, you would use

`tmux-topbar.sh --offset 90 man man`

This works by resizing the *larger* pane from the center line. 

If the *second* argument is either `-h` or `--hold` then TDAB will pause after 
executing the program and wait for you to hit a key (necessary for programs that 
exit immediately, which triggers the pane closing). 

If you run the scripts outside of tmux, it will just run the command.

### tmux_devour.sh

Launch a process in a new pane, zoom the pane, kill the pane when done.

### tmux_sidebar.sh

Create a sidebar (e.g. for reading manpages) and kill when done.

### tmux_topbar.sh

Create a vertical split and kill when done.

## 6. Examples

Aside from invoking on the command line, I've found a couple of short wrapper scripts 
really make a difference, particularly if you want a specific setup.

To call your editor in a new, full-screen pane (leaving the initial pane alone):

`/home/steven/bin/tmux_devour.sh /usr/bin/micro "${@}"`

To bring up [my address book searcher](https://github.com/uriel1998/ppl_virdirsyncer_addysearch) in a small topbar when I'm working in the 
main window:

`/home/steven/bin/tmux_topbar.sh --offset 80 pplsearch -c`

To bring up newsboat, with a sidebar showing a cheat sheet of things I forget using 
[rich-cli](https://github.com/Textualize/rich-cli), then closing it when I'm done.


```
/home/steven/bin/tmux_sidebar.sh rich -m /home/steven/cheatsheet/newsboat.md --pager 
newsboat
sidebarpid=$(ps aux | grep "rich -m /home/steven/cheatsheet/newsboat.md" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}')
kill $sidebarpid
```
